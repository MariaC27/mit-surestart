# MIT SureStart Program Responses

### Day 1 - July 6
learned of lambda function for iteration in python

### Day 2 - July 7
connected with team for the first time

### Day 3 - July 8
learned distinctions between AI, ML, and neural networks
- responses:
  - in supervised learning, the training data has labels and the model learns from feedback. in unsupervised learning, the training data doesn't include labels and the model instead groups similar items without labeling them
  - scikit needs data visualization libraries such as graphviz in order to properly visualize data

### Day 4 - July 12
a dataset I found interesting was the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. I think this could be useful for software that automatically transfers handwritten text in pictures into typed text (like a scanner that turns handwritten documents into text documents). This would use ML algorithms to correctly identify handwritten letters. I think a supervised ML algorithm would work best for this as the model can compare it's predictions to a "key" document with the correct labels and learn from its mistakes
